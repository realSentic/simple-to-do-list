Status Toggling: Functionality to mark tasks as complete or incomplete, providing visual feedback on progress.
Responsive Interface: The application layout is optimized for display across various devices, including desktop and mobile screens.
State Persistence (Optional): [Indicate if the application uses browser storage (e.g., Local Storage) to maintain task data between sessions, or if the state resets upon refresh.]
